## Day 1
Before diving into the code we talk about some fundamental concepts around stages in a data pipeline and what happens in each of those stages. To get a better understanding, basic actions at each stage of the pipeline are performed on a sample data set - from ingestion to prepraing very basic reports.

The excel files can be found int he day 1 folder

## Day 2
Next we code all the stages from ingestion to reporting in python using Jupyter notebooks. Files in the Day 02 folder.
